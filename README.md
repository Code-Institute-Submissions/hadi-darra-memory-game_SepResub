## Memory Game
A website for a Memory Game , "Memory game" is a fun game that you may have played in "real life", with actual paper tiles. It's called that because the main skill in the game is your memory - how well you can remember the position of tiles. It's also a game that can be re-created on a computer, and is a good example of using computer memory to remember information, like with arrays.

The website is implementation for which I have learned (HTML/CSS/JavaScript).
And I have built this website to present it for the project 2.
